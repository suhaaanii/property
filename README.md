# Product Showcase Django Project

This is a Django web application for showcasing products. Users can view a list of products, view individual product details, and add new products. The app also includes user authentication with login, registration, and logout functionality.

## Features

- **Product Showcase:** View a list of all products with details such as name, description, price, and image.
- **Product Details:** Click on a product to view its detailed information.
- **Add Product:** Admins can add new products via a form (Name, Description, Price, Image).
- **User Authentication:** Users can register, login, and log out.
  
## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Python 3.x
- Django
- Pillow (for image handling)

### Steps to Run the Project Locally

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/product-showcase.git
   cd product-showcase
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up database and run migrations:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Create a superuser for admin access (optional):**

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

7. **Access the application:**
   - The app will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
   - You can access the admin panel at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`.

### Media Files

To handle image uploads, ensure that your `MEDIA_URL` and `MEDIA_ROOT` are correctly set in your `settings.py`. Example:

```python
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')
```

Also, ensure you have the following in your `urls.py` to serve media files during development:

```python
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('products/', include('product.urls')),
]

# Serve media files during development
if settings.DEBUG:
    urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
```
